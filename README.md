无关人员谁再下载这个文件谁死妈的，我开放这个文件是为了给开发者，不是让你们闲的没事干在这提前体验吐槽的This project consists of two files. One is the b767_300er that can be displayed in the game after being converted to AF4 format. The other is the blender project file, where you can create paint jobs or write tmd files to improve the aircraft together. We hope it can fly in Aerofly as soon as possible
